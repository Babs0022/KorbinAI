## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) for a cool and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF) to provide a clean backdrop for glassmorphism.
- Accent color: Mint (#7FFFD4) to highlight key interactive elements, creating an intuitive UX.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, lending a contemporary and fashionable feel.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, known for its modern, neutral appearance, ideal for extended content.
- Crisp, modern icons that complement the overall aesthetic and improve user experience. For instance, icons related to prompt improvement will use arrows. Clear and simple symbols will add depth and clarity without clutter.
- Glassmorphic UI elements, especially in panels, will offer focus and a modern, professional look. Cool tones should prevail.
- Subtle transitions and animations (Framer Motion or CSS) on user interactions. Light fade-in animations should welcome the user and keep their attention fixed on their work.
